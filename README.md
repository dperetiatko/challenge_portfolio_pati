Task 1: software configuration 

Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I started to work as a QA Engineer in 2018. The same year I was trying to right my first scripts for automation using JS and company's own automation tool called Kraken.
However, we haven't invest too much time into that.
In 2020 I started to work on a new project which also needed automation. That time I chose python and pycharm, and I have met my goals. However, at the end of the year comany had to close the project. 
Right now I feel like I want to grow my expertise in automation and python is a language I familiar a bit better, compare to JS.
Also, I beleive I could earn more money doing automation.

I feel very excited to be here and participate in the challnge.
